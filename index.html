          <p>I am an avid software engineer and gamer. I've been working in the web landscape with numerous languages and tools as well as spearheading a small development team in an agile work environment. I've also worked as the sole engineer architecting iOS application solutions backed by Rails powered web servers using the secure PostgreSQL database. I've worked on the infrastructure for a discussion based website. Updated the features of an iOS application that rewards people for volunteering their time. I've built a video streaming solution for Living Scriptures, Inc. to distribute their library of numerous animations to their customers in new ways. In addition to the previous past projects, I've also build a social news application that will provide users with a new way to view the events happening around the world.</p>        </div>
